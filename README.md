# COVID-19-Safe-Entry-System

Due to today's mask and body temperature restrictions at various public places staff personnel have to manually check these and allow entry. 
Using manual system is a not very efficient often as there are many errors that can happen because of human involvement.

These problems have shown a need of a smart entry system which can check the temperature and face mask for a person before they are permitted inside  and can also keep a track of people who have entered or exited the building and how many are inside. 

So, this project works as a smart entry system and makes sure that the norms regulated to stop the spread of COVID-19 are implemented.

Our project is named "THE SENTINEL" - which means a guard who stands on the entrance and keeps watch.
